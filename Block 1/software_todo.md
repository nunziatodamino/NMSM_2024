## Exercise 6 MMC

- [x] change MAX_ANGLE from np.pi -> np.pi / 4
- [ ] decide if np.uniform() is a good candidate for the pivot rotation (maybe switch to np.random.normal())
- [ ] complete the thermalization process
    - write the variance function for each indicator (energy, end2end...)
    - save the thermalized configuration with the relative beta in a .txt file
- [ ] design the data collecting process and the MMC swap
