\chapter*{Exercise 9: Integration schemes}

The idea is to implement the velocity Verlet algorithm and the Gear predictor-correct algorithm of the 5th order specifically for the harmonic oscillator. \\
One can find said algorithms in the Algorithm appendix. \\
Before starting the quantitative analysis over these integration schemes, we start with a qualitative inspection against the analytical solution in figure \ref{ex9:schemes_comparison}. \\
Note that the integration timestep is $\Delta t = 0.001$ and $omega = 0.1$.

\end{figure}

Is clear that the Gear predictor-correct algorithm of the 5th order presents for long integration time an effect of amplitude reduction and delay, while the velocity Verlet algorithm do not presents these problems. \\
Now we study the energy conservation of the 2 algorithms. Again we plot the total energy of the system over time for inspection in figure \ref{ex9:energy_comparison} and for each algorithm we plot $\frac{E_{algo}(t) - E_0}{E_0}$ respectively in figure \ref{fig:side_by_side} for the velocity Verlet algorithm and the Gear predictor-correct algorithm of the 5th order.

From this analysis we conclude, as we expected, that the velocity Verlet algorithm is symplectic while the Gear predictor-corrector is not. \\
Lastly we focus on the velocity Verlet to evaluate its stability for different values of $\omega$. We choose for each iteration a timestep $\Delta t= 0.01\omega^{-1}$ and obtain the following
